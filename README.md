# CodeGenerator

By applying markers in the codes, it allows the marked section of the code to be turned into template blocks. Using substitution and template blocks, this increases the reusability. The substitution method allows hardcoded values to be organized and exposed to a csv or excel file. All marked code blocks can then be generated.
